# V2V_ElectricSharing

This repository is a implementation in parts of paper "A Bayesian Game Based Vehicle-to-Vehicle Electricity Trading Scheme for Blockchain-Enabled Internet of Vehicles" (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9078882) 

Note: This is part of the course CPE612 Game Theory. So, we focus on the game theory part. For the network part, we use a regular client-server network (not decentralized as the paper proposes)
